Our journey with Quantum Flytrap comes to an end. It has been an intense 3-year ride, a rollercoaster with ups and downs.

The company was founded by Klem Jankiewicz, a designer, and Piotr Migdał, a quantum physicist and AI specialist, with the goal of making quantum easy. And we still firmly believe that no matter the state of quantum hardware, quantum computing won't be usable at a scale without user-centered accessible interfaces.

While the startup ended, it was well beyond a learning lesson. Among other things, we created the following:

- Our core IP, a high-performance quantum numeric engine for real-time simulations in a browser.
- Pulser Studio, a web-based interface for Rydberg atom quantum computing for Pasqal.
- Virtual Lab, our tech demo, an acclaimed educational simulation of quantum information (coincidently, the topic of this year's Nobel Prize in physics) - used at Oxford and Stanford Universities, with over 700 user-created experiments by students and researchers all over the world.
- Peer-reviewed publications on the visualization of quantum mechanics and user interfaces for quantum computing.

We wouldn't have achieved that without our talented, remote-first team. We worked from Warsaw, Tel-Aviv, Singapore, San Francisco, Wrocław, Haifa, Kraków, and Kathmandu. First and foremost - we are grateful to Paweł Grabarz, our lead software engineer, a Rust magician, and numerics specialist. We would like to thank other team members, including Agata, Bijaya, Kamila, Natalia Helena, Alicja, Chiara, and Philippe - we could never do this without you! And especially to Artur Ekert, who set the spark by inviting us to the Center for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore, and later joined our advisory board.

We want to thank all those who supported us and gave us advice and feedback. Special thanks to Borys Musielak, Diana Koziarska and the SMOK Ventures, Tomek Kolinko, Christophe Jurczak, Witold Kowalczyk, Dominik Andrzejczuk, Piotr Kulczakowicz, Przemek Kowalczyk, Piotr Byrski, among many others.

And last but not least, we would like to thank you, the quantum community.
