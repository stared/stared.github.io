24-29 Jan 2016 I had a workshop for gifted high-school students of the [Polish Children's Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Children%27s_Fund) ([Krajowy Fundusz na rzecz Dzieci](http://fundusz.org/)) entitled _Interactive Data Visualization_. It was a part of workshops in practical computer science, at [ICM, University of Warsaw](http://www.icm.edu.pl/web/guest), organized by [@bolikowski](https://twitter.com/bolikowski).

![Students working in a lab](./2016-02-09-kfnrd_icm_work.jpg)

My intent was to show data visualization so they can start with getting data, and end up with a publicly-accessible data visualization.

Monday morning was for lectures introducing to the topics (others were: _Image Analysis_ and _Clustering of Languages_). Monday afternoon to Thursday evening - work of students, with some guidance. Friday morning - presentation of their results.

I had 5 participants (3 girls, 2 boys), who had background mostly in algorithms, with C++ as their primary language.

## Materials

- JavaScript
  - [Learn X in Y minutes, where X=JavaScript](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/) (telling that they should skip part about prototypes); mostly syntax, but it was enough
  - [MDN JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - as a reference
  - [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) - a thing that I typically recommend for learning JavaScript and programming (but didn't use it in this case)

- D3.js - specific aspects
  - [d3 categorical colors & Google colors](http://bl.ocks.org/aaizemberg/78bd3dade9593896a59d) - use nice colors, not e.g. `#00ff00` or `yellow`
  - [Modifying Graph Parameters](http://dhs.stanford.edu/dh/networks/)
  - [Notes on coincidence graphs and community detection in JS](https://github.com/stared/tagoverflow#methods-and-tricks)

  - [TagOverflow](http://p.migdal.pl/tagoverflow/) - coincidence of tags from the Stack Exchange network
  - [Map of KFnrD fellows and their interests, years 1997-2013](http://p.migdal.pl/kfnrd_viz/mapa.html)
- [Hackpad](https://hackpad.com/) for sharing links (to materials, data, projects, solutions to their particular projects). I find it more convenient that sending emails over and over (especially as 2 boys joined it the second day) and for plain text is is better than Google Docs (clear indication who added which line; no font size/style)
- Setting local server (`$ python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer` then open http://localhost:8000)
- Git - for version control
  - [Try Git](https://try.github.io/) for learning how it works and in general GitHub help
  - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for publishing their visualizations
- Habit of looking up code on websites with visualizations (hopefully).
- I should have shown:
  - [Searchable D3.js Gallery (2490 examples!)](http://christopheviau.com/d3list/gallery.html)
  - [The Fallen of World War 2](http://www.fallen.io/ww2/)
  - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

## Fruits

Maybe the most important - what were their projects?

- Julia Bazińska, [Influences of Philosophers - as of Wikipedia ](http://lamyiowce.github.io/philosophers-wiki/)
- Anna Urbala, [Star Wars Actors](http://floydwarshall.github.io/star_wars_actors/)
- Zuzanna Opała, [Jobs on Stack Overflow](https://zuuja.github.io/Jobs-on-Stack-Visualisation/)
- Dominik Kufel, [Bible Cross-Reference Visualization](https://dom98.github.io/Bible-Books-interconnections-visualization-using-d3.js/)

## Comments

I was extremely happy with the participants. I knew in advance that they were not "normal students", but still - got impressed by their motivation to learn, and that each of them made a project in this short timespan.
Moreover, they self-learned and applied quite a few things I hadn't shown.
I was not sure if starting with JavaScript syntax was enough. But it turned about that (as they knew C++), it was fine - and I think a good trade-off, given the time constraints.

I had a few data pieces in mind, but let them to choose their topic. It introduced some initial chaos, but I wanted to makes sure they have data they like and they are able to pick a sensible dataset.

Some projects required data wrangling, which they did in C++, C# and Perl. I was tempted to show Python but it was not enough time. I only showed [one Python script (Jupyter Notebook) to scrape Stack Overflow Jobs data](https://github.com/stared/Jobs-on-Stack-Visualisation/blob/master/careers%20data%20downloading.ipynb) and explained it step by step.

Force-directed graph is a black hole - once I showed it, all of the participants wanted to use it.
I have mixed feelings about it - I love them (TagOverflow, Themes of Polish Books, etc), but it is more high-level than the core D3.js API. And projects were not as diverse as they might have been.
