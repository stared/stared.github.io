# Minimum Viable Resume

I am open to ambitious challenges combining AI with the end-user experience.

I would happily consider industries such as medtech, biotech, and user-centric AI. Ideal roles include Data Science Tech Lead, Head of AI, Technical Product Manager, and CTO.

In the meantime, I am open to consulting and project-based work.

Feel free to contact me at `pmigdal@gmail.com` and connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotrmigdal/).
