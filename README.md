# Piotr Migda≈Ç - blog and website

For previous versions of the website, see:

- [stared/jekyll-blog-pre-2022](https://github.com/stared/jekyll-blog-pre-2022) - Jekyll static site
- [stared/old-blog-gridsome-pre-2024](https://github.com/stared/old-blog-gridsome-pre-2024) - Gridsome (Vue 2)
- Nuxt 3 Content (2024-2025) - Vue 3 + TypeScript

I migrated to Astro for a few reasons:

- Better performance with static site generation and modern optimizations
- Excellent content collections with built-in type safety via Zod schemas
- Great support for MDX, Vue components (when needed), and modern web standards
- Active maintenance and vibrant ecosystem
