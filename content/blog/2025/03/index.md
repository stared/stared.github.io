(A)I translated Virtual Lab into a few languages (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦) - our Quantum Flytrap became a polyglot! I hope this will make it easier for people worldwide to learn quantum physics. For some, it might simplify things - for others, it could be a doorway to a new world. Moreover, I wanted to give lecturers, teachers, and educators the opportunity to conduct classes in their native languages.

I used Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and enhanced the Chinese translation with DeepSeek R1. Once I set up the system and automatic verification for missing keys, the rest was a breeze with i18n - a standard tool for localization. I translated everything as complete files (not piece-by-piece) within the codebase, allowing the AI to understand the context in terms of both physics and UI components.

I've taken a look at the Polish translation, and it's quite decent. By extrapolation, I believe these models should work well for other languages too, especially for widely-used European ones like Castellano Spanish or Portuguese. With Mandarin Chinese, it's my leap of faith.

If you're a native speaker of any of these languages, I'd love to hear your take! Especially if you can compare it to the English version - to help distinguish between AI translation quirks and areas where the original material could be improved.

If the results are good, I'm open to translating it into other languages as well.
