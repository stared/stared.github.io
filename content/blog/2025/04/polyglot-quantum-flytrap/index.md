(A)I translated [Virtual Lab](https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/) into a few languages (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª) - our Quantum Flytrap became a polyglot! I hope this will make it easier for people worldwide to learn quantum physics. For some, it might simplify things - for others, it could be a doorway to a new world. Moreover, I wanted to give lecturers, teachers, and educators the opportunity to conduct classes in their native languages.

If you're a native speaker of any of these languages, I'd love to hear your take! Especially if you can compare it to the English version - to help distinguish between AI translation quirks and areas where the original material could be improved.

If the results are good, I'm open to translating it into other languages as well.

## Tech or Vibe Translating

### Models

I used Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and enhanced the Chinese translation with DeepSeek R1.
I based it on my experience with editing and translating things for my blog posts (and social media), where Claude 3.5 Sonnet is my go-to tool - high quality, while respecting my instructions, and adjusting to my style.

[LLM Chat Arena](https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard) offers leaderboard for various languages.
There is another project, showing tests on linguistic and cultural knowlage of [LLM for Polish language](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sdadas/plcc). As every ranking, while it is a good starting point, it
For example, while they list Gemini 2.5 as the top, for fine translations GPT 4.5 was (in my experience) way better.

From my anecdata, OpenAI o1 and o3 models enforce their own style.
Claude 3.7 Sonnet makes lacluster translations.
Gemini models were fine, so maybe they woud work similar.
GPT 4.5 is stunning. But in Cursor it costs $2 per call (not a typo), so I used it sparingly.

I haven't exactly tracted how much it cost me (since I am using Cursor for other projects), but I would estimate total cost at around \$40.

### Workflow

Once I set up the system and automatic verification for missing keys, the rest was a breeze with i18n - a standard tool for localization. I translated everything as complete files (not piece-by-piece) within the codebase, allowing the AI to understand the context in terms of both physics and UI components.

It was essentially "vibe translating" - not just using LLMs to help, but blindly accepting their suggestions. But even this way, there were some safeguards. First, I used `.cursor/rules` to guide the LLMs - to make translation idiomatic, consistent and scientifically accurate. Also, to balance correctness with playfulness.

Second, since there were large files, agent systems failed to do all translations at once. So after each translation, I asked it to run for check both for missing and extranous keys.

### Evaluation

Evaluation is hard. If a LLM has done that, it thinks it is the best approach. It is not reliable to ask about proficiency of a language for this task.

I've taken a look at the Polish translation, and is workable. I mean, it is not perfect, but grammatricaly correct and readable.
When it comes to physics, it the only change I made was to replace "intensywnoÅ›Ä‡" with "natÄ™Å¼enie" - a more idiomatic term for "intensity", when we talk about physics.

While the translation is not perfect, it seems to beat the industry standard.
UI button "back" translates as "back", or Aliexpress "save" as "ratuj" - a correct translation, but in the context of saving someone from fire, it might be a bit off. Or from a specialistic anatomy app, that used "plecy" for "back" UI button.

By extrapolation, I believe these models should work well for other languages too, especially for widely-used European ones like Castellano Spanish. With Mandarin Chinese, it's my leap of faith.

There is a different topic though - how to deal with links. Some links (e.g. to Wikipedia) have direct translations, some not.

## Which languages?

Translation had a concrete goal - make quantum physics more accessible. The original idea was to start with Castellano Spanish, as it is the most spoken language in the world, but I wanted to make it slightly more data driven - so, I looked at which are the most spoken languages in the world.

I used it as a proxy - right now, Virtual Lab is rather advanced, more suitable for undergraduate students than general audience. Making Quantum Game easier is still on the roadmap.

I made educated guesses with languages may work, and asked models on their cababilities. Most likely Hindu and Arabic is certantly on the list, but models were not certain.

An "OK translation" might be better than no translation, but no translation is better that something confusing, let along - gibberish.

Additionally, I added Polish. The idea was personal, but turned out to be a good way to evaluate the quality. I added Ukrainian for political reasons. German as it is the original language quantum mechanics.

## Bonus

Since the system is set up, it will be easy both to translate into other languages, and improving the current translations, automatically or manually. So, I slightly improved the current English version.

But also I wanted to add a twist.
But also I always wanted to try two things - make a Britsh one. I mean, use proper British English.

I also tried Lovecraftian esoteric, but it was cringe. There is a tiny layer,

Since I am already translating, I could not resist the temptation to add a few twists.
